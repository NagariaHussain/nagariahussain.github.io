            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The main purpose of the <a href="/" target="_blank">website</a> is to provide the user with <mark>Articles
                and Tutorials</mark> on the following topics:
            <ol class="mt-2">
                <li>Technology and Programming</li>

                <li>News: Short Articles</li>
            </ol>
            I chose to implement it as a <mark>5 page website</mark> which has a home page and one page for each of the
            above topics. The goal was to create a responsive website that provides its user with information in an
            organized and beautiful manner.

                    <strong>Mobile Hamburger Navigation:</strong> Most websites have hamburger navigation for mobile
                    screen sizes.
                    But the hamburger button is positioned at the top left corner of the screen (like many android
                    apps), this <mark>makes reaching to the button a little hard</mark> for people with small hands or
                    large smartphones. I have positioned the hamburger button <mark>at the bottom of the screen, which
                        makes it more reachable and user friendly</mark>.

                    <strong>CSS Custom Variables: </strong> When I wanted to theme my website, i.e., <mark>set a
                        different
                        theme color for each page using JavaScript</mark>, the requirement was to set a primary color
                    and change it based on the URL the user is currently on. I came across the concept of CSS Custom
                    Properties (a.k.a. CSS Variables). I
                    learned it using <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">this</a>
                    article on MDN. I have used 3 variables to control the color for a page:

                    <ol class="mt-2 mb-2">
                        <li><code>--primary-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--primary-backdrop-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--secondary-color</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    Now, if I want to change the primary color of a page, I <mark>can change it in just one place</mark>
                    and every other occurrence of the color changes automatically. I have used JavaScript to
                    <mark>change the value associated with the variables</mark> based on the URL (relative path to be
                    precise). For example, see the code snippet below:
                    <br><br><code>
                        if (location.pathname === "/pages/shorts.html") {<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-color', "#ffc93c");<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-backdrop-color', "rgba(255, 201, 60, 0.6)");<br>
                        }
                    </code><br><br>

                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Modal: </strong> Modals are <mark>part of many websites</mark> and are a way to display
                    information only when it is required. So, I <mark>searched how to create a modal on Google and found
                        many articles</mark> that showed how to do it. I learned to create a modal using <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">this W3Schools
                        article</a>. I started with the code given on the above
                    website and changed some CSS to match it with my web page. I also <mark>added show and hide
                        animations</mark> to improve the UX.

                    <strong>Intersection Observer API: </strong> I have seen this cool effect on many websites, where
                    <mark>some elements animate into the view as we scroll the page</mark>. I wanted to implement this
                    on my website. I looked for possible
                    methods to do the same. Although, there are<mark> many external JS Libraries available for this
                        task</mark> but using the <code>IntersectionObserver</code> API is native and hence <mark>I
                        decided to implement the effect without the use of any external library</mark>.
                    This effect can be seen on the home page: the category <code>div</code>s and avatars animate as you
                    scroll to their position.

                I have learned <mark>many more new things</mark>, I have written some of them as comment in the
