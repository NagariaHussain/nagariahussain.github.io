            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The main purpose of the <a href="/" target="_blank">website</a> is to provide the user with <mark>Articles and Tutorials</mark> on the following topics:
            <ol class="mt-2">
                <li>Technology and Programming</li>
                <li>Travel and Tourism</li>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>News: Short Articles</li>
            </ol>
            I chose to implement it as <mark>5 page website</mark> which has a home page and one page for each of the above topics. The goal was to create a responsive website that provides its user with information in an organized and beautiful manner.

            <h2>3 things I had to learn/find out by myself when creating my site, and describe how I did that</h2>
            <ol class="mt-3">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Flexbox: </strong>When I was digging more into layouts using CSS, I came across
                    <mark>Flexbox and how it
                        can make creating responsive layouts</mark> very easy. As it was not covered in the module, I learned it using the below resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS Grids and Flexbox for Responsive Web Design (course by Frontendmasters): <a target="_blank" href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/">View the course here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>A complete guide to Flexbox (CSS-TRICKS): <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Here</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>CSS Custom Variables: </strong> When I wanted to theme my website, i.e., <mark>set a
                        different
                        theme color for each page using JavaScript</mark>, the requirement was to set a primary color and change it based on the URL the user is currently on. I came across the concept of CSS Custom Properties (a.k.a. CSS Variables). I
                    learned it using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">this</a> article on MDN. I have used 3 variables to control the color for a page:

                    <ol class="mt-2 mb-2">
                        <li><code>--primary-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--primary-backdrop-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--secondary-color</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    Now, if I want to change the primary color of a page, I <mark>can change it in just one place</mark> and every other occurence of the color changes automatically. I have used JavaScript to <mark>change the value associated with the variables</mark>                    based on the URL (relative path to be precise). For example, see the code snippet below:
                    <br><br><code>
                        if (location.pathname === "/pages/shorts.html") {<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-color', "#ffc93c");<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-backdrop-color', "rgba(255, 201, 60, 0.6)");<br>
                        }
                    </code><br><br>

                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Modal: </strong> Modals are <mark>part of many websites</mark> and are a way to display information only when it is required. So, I <mark>searched how to create a modal on Google and found
                        many articles</mark> that showed how to do it. I learned to create a modal using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">this W3Schools article</a>. I started with the code given on the above
                    website and changed some CSS to match it with my web page. I also <mark>added show and hide animations</mark> to improve the UX.

                    <strong>Date Object: </strong> The JavaScript <code>Date</code> object gives us access to many functions and data related to date and time. I used the <mark>MDN reference</mark> to learn about the different methods available on the
                    Date object. I have used the Date object to get the current year and some DOM manipulation to set the copyright year to the current year. This way, we <mark>don't have to manually update the year next to the &copy; icon</mark> every
                    year:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        // Get current year
                        <br>
                        const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
                        <br>
                        // Update span text
                        <br>
                        copyrightYearSpan.innerText = currentYear;

                    <strong>Intersection Observer API: </strong> I have seen this cool effect on many websites, where, <mark>some elements animate into the view as we scroll the page</mark>. I wanted to implement this in my website. I looked for possible
                    methods to do the same. Although, there are<mark> many external JS Libraries available for this task</mark> but using the <code>IntersectionObserver</code> API is native and hence <mark>I decided to implement the effect without the use of any external library</mark>.
                    This effect can be seen on the home page: the category <code>div</code>s and avatars animate as you scroll to their position.
