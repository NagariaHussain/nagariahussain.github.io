            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The main purpose of the website is to provide the user with <mark>Articles and Tutorials</mark> on the following topics:
            <ol class="mt-2">
                <li>Technology and Programming</li>
                <li>Travel and Tourism</li>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>News: Short Articles</li>
            </ol>
            I chose to implement it as <mark>5 page website</mark> which has a home page and one page for each of the above topics. The goal was to create a responsive website that provides its user with information in an organized and beautiful manner.

                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Flexbox: </strong>When I was digging more into layouts using CSS, I came across
                    <mark>Flexbox and how it
                        can make creating responsive layouts</mark> very easy. As it was not covered in the module, I learned it using the below resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS Grids and Flexbox for Responsive Web Design (course by Frontendmasters): <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/">View the course here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>A complete guide to Flexbox (CSS-TRICKS): <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Here</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>CSS Custom Variables: </strong> When I wanted to theme my website, i.e., <mark>set a different
                    theme color for each page using JavaScript</mark>, the requirement was to set a primary color and change it based on the URL the user is currently on. I came across the concept of CSS Custom Properties (a.k.a. CSS Variables). I learned
                    it using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">this</a> article on MDN. I have used 3 variables to control the color for a page:

                    <ol class="mt-2 mb-2">
                        <li><code>--primary-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--primary-backdrop-color</code></li>
                        <li><code>--secondary-color</code></li>
                    </ol>

                    I have used JavaScript to <mark>change the value associated with the variables</mark> based on the URL (relative path to be precise). For example, see the code snippet below:
                    <br><br><code>
                        if (location.pathname === "/pages/shorts.html") {<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-color', "#ffc93c");<br>
                            root.style.setProperty('--primary-backdrop-color', "rgba(255, 201, 60, 0.6)");<br>
                        }
                    </code><br><br>

                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Modal: </strong> Modals are <mark>part of many websites</mark> and are a way to display information only when it is required. So, I <mark>searched how to create a modal on Google and found many articles</mark> that showed how
                    to do it. I learned to create a modal using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">this W3Schools article</a>. I started with the code given on the above website and changed some CSS to match it with my web
                    page. I also <mark>added show and hide animations</mark> to improve the UX.
