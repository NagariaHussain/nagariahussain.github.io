            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The main purpose of the website is to provide the user with <mark>Articles and Tutorials</mark> on the
            following topics:
            <ol class="mt-2">
                <li>Technology and Programming</li>
                <li>Travel and Tourism</li>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>News: Short Articles</li>
            </ol>
            I chose to implement it as <mark>5 page website</mark> which has a home page and one page for each of the
            above topics.

            The goal was to create a responsive website that provides its user with
            information in an organized and beautiful manner.

                    <strong>Dribble:</strong>
                    Before I started to create wireframes, I used dribble to get some design inspiration.
                    I searched for magazine website designs and found many stunning designs there.

                    My navigation and footer are highly inspired by <a

                    I have used <mark>proper semantic and element tags</mark> to make the different parts of the website
                    more accessible.
                    For instance, use of <code>article</code> and <code>figure</code> tags are used instead of plan
                    <code>div</code> tags.

                    <strong>Flexbox: </strong>When I was digging more into layouts using CSS, I came across <mark>Flexbox and how it
                    can make creating responsive layouts</mark> very easy. As it was not covered in the module, I learned it using the below resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS Grids and Flexbox for Responsive Web Design (course by Frontendmasters): <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/">View the course here</a></li>

                    <strong>Modal: </strong> Modals are <mark>part of many websites</mark> and are a way to display information only when it is required.
                    So, I <mark>searched how to create a modal on Google and found many articles</mark> that showed how to do it.
                    I learned to create a modal using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">this W3Schools article</a>.
                    I started with the code given on the above website and changed some CSS to match it with my web page. I also <mark>added show and hide animations</mark> to improve the UX.
